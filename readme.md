The theme of the dissertation is practical and theoretical development of web applications using modern technologies. Creating a web application is divided into several parts. In the first part technologies that will be used during the development of applications are being chosen, followed by setting the conditions and requirements that the database must comply with the web application. Once the database has been created, begins the development of web application respecting the MVC paradigm and thus separating parts of the application in the individual directories. It is necessary to set up models while respecting the already defined relationships from the database since the models are responsible for working with the database. Controllers are the interface between the model and the view, after receiving requests from users, they must process those requests, and then submit the required information to the view which is presented to the user.
